# Surprising EX

## Project overview

Surprising EX is a Java and Maven based exchange backend under active development. It provides order matching, accounts, risk management, market data, and APIs for six separate product lines:

| Product line | Main functions |
| --- | --- |
| Spot | Orders, matching, asset holds, and settlement |
| USDT-margined perpetuals | Positions, margin, funding, and liquidation |
| Coin-margined perpetuals | Inverse contract accounting, funding, and risk |
| USDT-margined delivery futures | Positions and expiry settlement |
| Coin-margined delivery futures | Inverse contracts and expiry settlement |
| Options | Premiums, positions, exercise, and expiry |

Product line identity controls routing and keeps instruments, accounts, trading state, events, and risk rules separate. The single-node deployment below starts **USDT-margined perpetuals only** (`LINEAR_PERPETUAL`).

## Architecture

Backend snapshot field evolution and historical command recovery: [恢复兼容设计](docs/core-snapshot-evolution.md).

The single-node stack has six Java processes:

| Process | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Aeron Core | Ordered commands, matching, authoritative balances and positions, snapshots, and recovery |
| Gateway | Authentication, instrument, account and order APIs, WebSocket access, and the shared application Aeron MediaDriver |
| Price | Index and mark prices |
| Realtime | Market data, candles, trade export, and realtime routing |
| Derivatives lifecycle | Funding, risk scans, and liquidation workflows |
| Maker | Reference-market-based quotes and trading |
